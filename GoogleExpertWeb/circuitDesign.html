              <h2>PCB Design </h2>
              <p>Whether you require a circuit design or a PCB design we at GoodExpert Tech LLC can help you. We will review the details of the PCB in terms of size, features and assembly requirements and we will use the latest CAD software available to design the PCB layout for you. We can design the circuit based on your requirements or you may supply us the circuit schematics and we will follow the interconnection in the schematics to design the PCB layout. Our PCB Engineer runs the PCB design through our design rules and make
                 sure it is manufacturable and the cost of PCB is not higher than norm.</p>
